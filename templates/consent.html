            You are invited to participate in a research study about understanding how people perform tasks using graphs and charts. 
            You have been asked to participate because you have indicated interest to participate on Prolific.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of the research is to understand how different charts affect how people use them do tasks.
            This study will include participants who are 18 years old or above, speak fluent English, and do not have blindness or low vision conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>What will you do?</h3>
        <p>
            If you decide to participate, you will be asked to look at bar charts and answer questions based on the charts.
            There will be multiple trials, with each trial lasting a few seconds. 
            There are a total of four sections, each containing 20 to 25 trials.
            Finally, you will answer some questions based on your experience.
            Your participation will last approximately <strong>25 minutes</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>
        <p>
            You can stop the study at any time. Even if you start the study, you are not required to complete it.
            All your answers will be confidential and will not be shared outside the research team.
        </p>

        <h3>Compensation</h3>
        <p>
            If you decide to participate in the study, you will receive <strong>$5</strong>.
            The compensation is based on the Prolific standard rate of $12/hr and the expected duration of 25 minutes.
            The compensation is $5 even if you complete the study faster or slower.
        </p>
